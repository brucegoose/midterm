  <h1>Who Is Andrew Brucella?</h1>
  <p> Thanks for Asking! </p>
  <p> As you know by now, my name is Andrew Brucella. I am currently a Senior at Quinnipiac University who is majoring in Computer Information Systems and minoring in Finance. What do I want to do when I graduate? <b>I HAVE NO IDEA! </b> Hopefully I will figure that out soon, but in the mean time here is a list of things that I love the most: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> <b><em>Jesus</em></b></li>  My Faith and relationship with God is by far the most important thing in my life. I grew up in a Christian family, went to a Christian school, and attended church regularly. However, when I was older I began to doubt my faith; I felt as though I were believing because of tradition, not because of truth. Is there <i>really</i> a God, or is life just a product of time and chance? If there is a God, can I <i>really</i> know Him? Along with a million other questions in my head, I began searching and seeking the truth for myself. As it turns out, the evidence for the divinity of Jesus and the accuracy of the historical Bible is astounding and undeniable. After I understood as much as I needed to, namely that I am a broken person living in a broken world in need of a perfect savior, I rededicated my life to Christ and my life has never been the same since! <a href="https://carm.org">Here</a> is a website that has helped me answer many questions in regards to Christianity.
    <li> <b><em>Carolina Panthers</em></b> </li> Nothing screams "Andrew Brucella" quite like the Carolina Panthers do. Growing up, I always wanted to be "different." Whether that meant trying to write notes in school left-handed or liking things that my peers didn't, I always felt the need to go against the grain. I remember first getting into football. A lot of these memories are of my dad and I spending Sunday's watching the <font color="blue">BIG BLUE</font>, or the New York Giants. But like I said, being different meant liking different things, including sports team. In 2003, I broke my dad's heart by officially becoming a Carolina Panther's fan. It's been a long road (mostly filled with losses), but this season looks very promising!
    <li> <b><em> Guitar</em> </b> </li> One of my absolute favorite things to do in my down-time is play my guitar. I began playing in 8th grade, mostly because I thought that it would be cool to say that I know how to play guitar. I quickly began to realize that being able to play music offers an entirely different life experience. Though I'm no guitar master, I really enjoy playing and just learning different songs. My favorite aspect about playing guitar is that learning a new song offers a challenge, and mastering the song offers such a satisfying reward!
